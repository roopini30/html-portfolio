I am Roopini, I identify myself as a mother of two beautiful boys. Now that my beautiful boys have grown up to a stage where they could take care of themselves and my attention is not needed
 constantly, I am focusing on me and my passion. I love creating things and learning. I wanted to create beautiful websites and become a successful web developer.
